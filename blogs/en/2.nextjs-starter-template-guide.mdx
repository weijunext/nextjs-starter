## Why You Need a Next.js Starter Template

Building a modern website from scratch is time-consuming. You need to set up routing, styling, internationalization, SEO, analytics, and more. That's where a well-crafted starter template becomes invaluable.

**Next.js Starter** is a **lightweight**, multilingual Next.js 16 template designed for quickly launching small websites. Whether you're building a free tool site, content site, personal blog, or landing page — clone it, configure it, and deploy in minutes.

## Essential Features, Nothing More

### 🌐 Built-in Internationalization (i18n)

One of the biggest challenges in building global websites is implementing proper internationalization. This template comes with **next-intl** integration, supporting:

- **Three languages out of the box**: English, Chinese, and Japanese
- **Locale-based routing**: `/en`, `/zh`, `/ja` paths
- **Easy translation management**: JSON-based translation files
- **Language detection alert**: Automatically suggests switching language based on browser settings

Adding a new language is as simple as:
1. Creating a new translation file in `i18n/messages/`
2. Updating the routing configuration
3. Adding content for the new locale

### 📝 MDX Blog System

Write your blog posts in MDX - the perfect combination of Markdown simplicity and React component power:

- **Frontmatter support**: Title, description, tags, date, visibility control
- **Pin important posts**: Featured posts appear first
- **Draft mode**: Work on posts without publishing them
- **Per-locale blogs**: Different content for different languages
- **Custom components**: Use React components inside your Markdown

### 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

The template uses **Tailwind CSS** combined with **shadcn/ui** components:

- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark/Light theme toggle with system preference detection
- Clean, professional aesthetics
- Easy to customize with CSS variables

### ⚙️ Centralized Site Configuration

All your site information in one place - just edit `config/site.ts`:

```typescript
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Site Name",
  tagLine: 'Your Tagline',
  description: "Your site description",
  url: BASE_URL,
  authors: [{ name: "You", url: "https://yoursite.com" }],
  socialLinks: { twitter, github, discord, email },
  icons: { icon, shortcut, apple },
}
```

No more hunting through multiple files to update basic information. Change it once, and it reflects everywhere - in metadata, footer, Open Graph tags, and more.

### 📄 Ready-to-Use Legal Pages

Every website needs legal pages. This template includes multilingual templates for:

- **About Page** (`content/about/`)
- **Privacy Policy** (`content/privacy-policy/`)
- **Terms of Service** (`content/terms-of-service/`)

Each page supports all three languages (en, zh, ja) out of the box. Just customize the MDX content to match your needs.

### 🔍 SEO Essentials

The template includes a practical metadata utility (`lib/metadata.ts`) that handles:

- **Dynamic title generation** with proper formatting
- **Automatic sitemap.xml generation**
- **robots.txt configuration**
- **Open Graph and Twitter cards** with image support
- **Canonical URLs and hreflang tags** for multilingual SEO
- **Alternate language links** for all supported locales
- **Server-side rendering** for fast initial load

Just call `constructMetadata()` with your page info and get perfectly formatted metadata for search engines and social sharing.

### 📊 One-Line Analytics Integration

Track your visitors with multiple analytics platforms - just add your IDs to `.env`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS=G-XXXXXXXX

NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ADSENSE=ca-pub-XXXXXXXX

NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAUSIBLE_SRC=https://
```

Supported platforms:
- **Google Analytics** - Track user behavior and traffic sources
- **Google AdSense** - Monetize your content
- **Plausible Analytics** - Privacy-friendly, GDPR-compliant analytics
- **Vercel Analytics** - Built-in performance monitoring

Each analytics component is conditionally loaded only in production, keeping your development environment clean.

### 📧 Simple Newsletter with Resend

A basic newsletter subscription to start building your audience:

- **Ready-to-use subscription form** in the footer
- **Email validation** with basic error handling
- **Resend integration** for reliable email delivery
- **Welcome email templates** included
- **Rate limiting** with Upstash Redis to prevent abuse

The newsletter feature uses [Resend](https://resend.com) - a modern email API built for developers. Simply add your Resend API key to the environment variables:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID=your_audience_id
```

You also get pre-built React email templates in the `emails/` folder:
- `newsletter-welcome.tsx` - Welcome email for new subscribers
- `submission-notification.tsx` - Notification when someone submits a product
